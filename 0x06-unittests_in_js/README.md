# Unittests in JS
Unittests are a way to test your code. They are small tests that you write to make sure that your code is working as expected. They are a great way to make sure that your code is working as expected and to catch bugs early. In this project, we will be writing unittests for our JavaScript code using Mocha and Chai.
